# TinderRemastered

This app is the completed Tinder app (completed front end at least).  If you are unfamiliar with Tinder, it is a dating app that made the swipe left

This app features Kingfisher - a pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web.  

The completed app looks as such:
